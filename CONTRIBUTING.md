# Contributing to Zeebe

Most of the contributing guidelines are copied from the [Zeebe contributing](github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe/CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines. 

## Reporting issues or contact developers

Zeebe uses GitHub issues to organize the development process. If you want to
report a bug or request a new feature feel free to open a new issue on
[GitHub][issues].

If you are reporting a bug, please help to speed up problem diagnosis by
providing as much information as possible. Ideally, that would include a small
[sample project][sample] that reproduces the problem.

If you have a general usage question please ask on the [forum][] or [slack][] channel.

## GitHub Issue Guidelines

Every issue should have a meaningful name and a description which either
describes:
- a new feature with details about the use case the feature would solve or
  improve
- a problem, how we can reproduce it and what would be the expected behavior
- a change and the intention how this would improve the system
