This and the fact that summer and winter time shifts can cause in other systems evil bugs, we wanted to find out how our system can handle time shifts. Phil joined me as participant and observer. There was a related issue which covers this topic as well, zeebe-chaos#3.","date":"2021-05-25T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 25, 2021","tags":[{"label":"data","permalink":"/zeebe-chaos/tags/data"}],"readingTime":8.265,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"Christopher Zell","title":"Chaos Engineer @ Zeebe","url":"https://github.com/zelldon","imageURL":"https://github.com/zelldon.png","key":"zell"}],"prevItem":{"title":"Full Disk Recovery","permalink":"/zeebe-chaos/2021/06/08/Full-Disk"},"nextItem":{"title":"Play around with ToxiProxy","permalink":"/zeebe-chaos/2020/10/06/toxi-proxy"}}},{"id":"Play around with ToxiProxy","metadata":{"permalink":"/zeebe-chaos/2020/10/06/toxi-proxy","editUrl":"https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe-chaos/blog/2020-10-06-toxi-proxy/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2020-10-06-toxi-proxy/index.md","title":"Play around with ToxiProxy","description":"First chaos day since my parental leave.","date":"2020-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 6, 2020","tags":[{"label":"tools","permalink":"/zeebe-chaos/tags/tools"}],"readingTime":3.27,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"Christopher Zell","title":"Chaos Engineer @ Zeebe","url":"https://github.com/zelldon","imageURL":"https://github.com/zelldon.png","key":"zell"}],"prevItem":{"title":"Time travel Experiment","permalink":"/zeebe-chaos/2021/05/25/Reset-Clock"}}}]}')}}]);
