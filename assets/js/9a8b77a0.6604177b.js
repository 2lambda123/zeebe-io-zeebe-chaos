This was based on an earlier incident, which we had seen in production. One suggested approach to resolve that incident was to increase the time, such that all messages are removed from the state. This and the fact that summer and winter time shifts can cause in other systems evil bugs, we wanted to find out how our system can handle time shifts. Phil joined me as participant and observer. There was a related issue which covers this topic as well, zeebe-chaos#3.","date":"2021-05-25T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 25, 2021","tags":[{"label":"data","permalink":"/zeebe-chaos/tags/data"}],"readingTime":8.265,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"Christopher Zell","title":"Chaos Engineer @ Zeebe","url":"https://github.com/zelldon","imageURL":"https://github.com/zelldon.png","key":"zell"}],"prevItem":{"title":"Full Disk Recovery","permalink":"/zeebe-chaos/2021/06/08/Full-Disk"},"nextItem":{"title":"Corrupted Snapshot Experiment Investigation","permalink":"/zeebe-chaos/2021/04/29/Corrupted-Snapshot"}}},{"id":"Corrupted Snapshot Experiment Investigation","metadata":{"permalink":"/zeebe-chaos/2021/04/29/Corrupted-Snapshot","editUrl":"https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe-chaos/blog/2021-04-29-Corrupted-Snapshot/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-04-29-Corrupted-Snapshot/index.md","title":"Corrupted Snapshot Experiment Investigation","description":"A while ago we have written an experiment, which should verify that followers are not able to become leader, if they have a corrupted snapshot.
