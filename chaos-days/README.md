# Chaos Day

We will spent a day in a week to explore our system, documenting failure cases, building a hypothesis backlog and running chaos experiments, such that we can build more confidence in our system.
It is planned to happen every thursday. We will create a summary after each chaos day, what we have done and share results of the chaos experiments, such that we can share the knowledge, if we found a weakness or the confidence that we were able to withstand a failure scenario.
