            <description><![CDATA[Due to some incidents and critical bugs we observed in the last weeks, I wanted to spent some time to understand the issues better and experiment how we could detect them. One of the issue we have observed was that keys were generated more than once, so they were no longer unique (#8129). I will describe this property in the next section more in depth.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Recently we run a Game day where a lot of messages with high TTL have been stored in the state. This was based on an earlier incident, which we had seen in production. One suggested approach to resolve that incident was to increase the time, such that all messages are removed from the state. This and the fact that summer and winter time shifts can cause in other systems evil bugs, we wanted to find out how our system can handle time shifts. Phil joined me as participant and observer. There was a related issue which covers this topic as well, zeebe-chaos#3.]]></description>

You can find that specific experiment here. This experiment was executed regularly against Production-M and Production-S Camunda Cloud cluster plans. With the latest changes, in the upcoming 1.0 release, we changed some behavior in regard to detect snapshot corruption on followers.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[In the last game day (on friday 06.11.2020) I wanted to test whether we can break a partition if many messages time out at the same time. What I did was I send many many messages with a decreasing TTL, which all targeting a specific point in time, such that they will all timeout at the same time. I expected that if this happens that the processor will try to time out all at once and break because the batch is to big. Fortunately this didn't happen, the processor was able to handle this.]]></description>
